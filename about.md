# About

## Hi, 


I am Siddharth and I usually go by Sid. 
<br>

I'm a systems architect and I build platforms for businesses. I've been working in tech for nearly 15 years and I've spent the last 8 on building systems for Fintech companies. 
<br>

Most recently, I led the engineering teams at Simpl and TrustingSocial. 
<br>

I care about data, finance and people. Building cohesive, deterministic and interpretable systems that offer insights for your business or a complex consumer facing platform is where I thrive. 
<br>

Building great platforms requires building great teams and is one of the most nuanced skills in our industry. I run a technology firm called Core27 that helps businesses build cohesive teams and better platforms.

# Initial Commit

I intend to document my journey into ML and the areas that have tripped me along the way. This blog is largely to serve as a documentation of my mistakes and cheatsheets. 
My goals with these posts not aimed at writing but as a means to migrate lot of the resources I store as references to a more permanent location.

As part of the initial exercise I intend to move a lot of the information I have stored on stats, ML and Math onto this, followed by posts on Docker Swarm, Terraform and ECS

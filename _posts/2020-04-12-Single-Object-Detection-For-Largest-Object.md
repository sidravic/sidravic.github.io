# Single Object Detection (Largest Object in the Image - Actually YOLO)

While I'm losing my mind trying to get the multiple object detection using SSD to work, here's a link to a working Notebook that classifies and identifies the images from the Pascal 2007 dataset. 

The regression is still not perfect but you get the idea. 

This uses a Linear layer as the final layer instead of a Convolution so YOLO.
